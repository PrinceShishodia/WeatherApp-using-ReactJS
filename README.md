# WeatherApp-using-ReactJS

The Weather App is a dynamic and feature-rich web application developed using ReactJS and powered by the OpenWeather API. It provides users with real-time weather updates and forecasts for locations worldwide.
It first asks for the location access of the user, so as to provide the weather forecast information of the user's locality and also the user can type in any location across the globe to fetch the real-time weather updates of that location.
